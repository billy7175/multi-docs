## 1. 자기소개 / 친구 소개 (Self-introduction / Introducing a Friend)

**자기소개**  
Hi, my name is Billy, and I'm from Korea. Let me briefly introduce myself. I'm currently taking a career break. Previously, I worked as a frontend developer.
About a year ago, I decided to quit my job to pursue items on my bucket list — things I had always wanted to do but never had the chance to.
Now, I'm getting ready to restart my career. In the past, I was quite confident in my skills as a developer. However, with the rapid rise of AI technologies, I've been reflecting on my career path and thinking about how I can adapt and continue to grow.
It is an exciting time, and I'm very looking forward to the next chapter of my journey.

## 2. 취미 활동 (Hobbies)

I have several hobbies that I enjoy in my daily life. One of my favorite hobbies is playing basketball. It not only keeps me physically active but also helps me relieve stress. I usually play with my friends at a nearby court on weekends.
Another hobby of mine is watching movies. I especially enjoy thrillers because I like trying to guess what will happen next. Recently, I’ve also started reading novels more regularly. I find that reading improves my concentration and gives me new ideas.

## 3. 여가시간 활용 (How I Spend My Free Time)

How I spend my free time depends on my mood and energy level. When I want to relax, I usually listen to music or take a walk outside. It helps me clear my mind and feel refreshed.
Sometimes, I meet friends for a casual chat or explore new cafes. I enjoy trying different types of coffee. At home, I often watch YouTube videos, especially English learning content or travel vlogs. I also try to review what I studied or reflect on my goals. I believe free time is a chance not just to rest, but also to grow.




## 4. 여행, 호텔 예약, 항공편 문제 (Travel, Hotel Booking, Flight Issues)

When I was traveling in Thailand, I had a small issue with my hotel reservation. I had booked the hotel online a few weeks in advance, but when I arrived, the receptionist told me that they couldn’t find my name in the system.
At first, I was quite nervous, but I stayed calm and showed them the confirmation email I had received. After checking again, they finally gave me a room.
On my return trip, my flight was delayed by three hours due to bad weather. Although waiting at the airport wasn’t fun, I tried to use the time well by reading a book and listening to music. It reminded me that things don’t always go as planned when traveling, but staying flexible really helps.

## 5. 사건 경험 묘사 (Memorable or Embarrassing Experience)

**잊지 못할 경험 (A Memorable Experience)**
One of the most memorable experiences in my life was watching the sunrise at Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I woke up very early and arrived at the temple before dawn. As the sun slowly rose behind the ancient structure, the sky turned orange and pink.
The moment was quiet and beautiful, and I felt completely connected to nature. It made me realize how small I am in this big world and how important it is to appreciate each moment.

**실수한 경험 (An Embarrassing Experience)**
I once made an embarrassing mistake when I sent a personal message to the wrong person. I meant to send it to a close friend, but I accidentally sent it to my teacher.
It was a light-hearted and funny message, but it was still a bit inappropriate for a teacher. As soon as I realized my mistake, I apologized immediately. Fortunately, my teacher had a good sense of humor and didn’t take it seriously. It taught me to always double-check before hitting “send.”

## 6.동네 소개
I live in a three-bedroom apartment located in a fairly busy neighborhood. Although it's not in the countryside, it's not overly noisy either. There are several roads nearby, so I do hear some traffic from time to time, especially during rush hour.

One of the things I like about my neighborhood is that there’s a park and a small stream just a few minutes away from my apartment. It's a nice place to take a walk, exercise, or just enjoy some fresh air. I sometimes go there to clear my head after a long day.

My apartment itself is quite spacious, with three bedrooms, which is perfect for my needs. Overall, my neighborhood isn’t quiet like a rural area, but it has a good balance between convenience and comfort.



## 7. Difficulties Experienced During Overseas Travel [해외 여행 시 어려움]
`Question:` Tell me about a challenging experience you had while traveling abroad. What difficulties did you face and how did you handle them?

`Answer:`
I think language barriers are one of the biggest challenges when traveling abroad. You know, it's really difficult to communicate with locals when you don't speak their language.
So yeah, I went to China last year. And for sure, as soon as I got there, I ran into a problem. In China, I went to this small local restaurant. The menu had no pictures and no English at all. I tried using a translation app, but it wasn't working well.
Finally, I just pointed at a random dish that looked good in a picture on the wall. The food was amazing when it arrived - this hot, delicious dish with amazing smells. But the funny part is that I have no idea what I ate, lol! I couldn't tell if it was pork, beef, or something else entirely. So funny, right?! That's what I experienced from the language barrier.
After that trip, I learned to prepare better. Now I always learn a few basic phrases before traveling to another country - things like "I'm allergic to nuts" or "Where's the bathroom?" Locals really appreciate when you try to speak their language, even if you're not very good at it.# OPIC English Speaking Test Scripts
